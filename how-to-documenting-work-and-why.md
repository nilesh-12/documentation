##### Steps
	Step 1: Identify and Name the Process
	Figure out which process you are going to document first. Determine its purpose (why and how the process will benefit the organization) and provide a brief description of the process.
	
	Step 2: Define the Process Scope
	Provide a brief description of what is included in the process and what is out of the process scope, or what is not included in it.
	
	Step 3: Explain the Process Boundaries
	Where does the process begin and end? What causes it to start? And how do you know when it’s done? Get these boundaries well defined.
	
	Step 4: Identify the Process Outputs
	Establish what will be produced by the process or what result the process will achieve once it is completed.
	
	Step 5: Identify the Process Inputs
	List down what resources are necessary to carry out each of the process steps.
	
	Step 6: Brainstorm the Process Steps
	Gather all information on process steps from start to finish.  Either start with what triggers the process or start at the end of the process and track back the steps to the starting point.
	
	The brainstorming session should involve those who are directly responsible for the process tasks or someone with extensive knowledge of it, as they can provide precise data.
	
	 Step 7: Organize the Steps Sequentially
	Take the list of steps you’ve come up with and put them in a sequential order to create a process flow.
	
	Keep the number of steps to a minimum and if a step includes more than one task, list them under the main step.
	
	Step 8: Describe who is Involved
	Decide each individual who will be responsible for the process tasks. Define their roles. Keep in mind to mention their job title rather than their name.
	
	Also be considerate about those who would be referencing the document. Write it in a way that any employee with a reasonable knowledge can read and understand it.
	
	Step 9: Visualize the Process
	This is to improve clarity and readability of your documentation. Using a process flowchart, neatly visualize the process steps you’ve identified earlier.

	Step 10: Note down Exceptions to the Normal Process Flow
	A business process may not always follow the same flow due to various reasons. Mention these exceptions and what steps will be taken to address them.
	
	Step 11: Add Control Points and Measurements
	Identify where risks could occur in the process and add control points to help the process owner when monitoring the process.
	
	Establish measurements to determine the effectiveness of the process and to help improve it.
	
	Step 12: Review and Test the Process
	Gather everyone involved and review the process flowchart you’ve mapped. Are there any missing steps? Is everything in order? Once done, test the process and see if you’ve missed anything.
